## 🏗️ Architecture: Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)

FSD is a modern architectural pattern for frontends that ensures scalability and clean dependency management. The project is organized into strictly defined layers:

### Layers Hierarchy
1.  **App**: Global setup, providers, and global styles.
2.  **Pages**: Full-screen views composed of widgets and features.
3.  **Widgets**: Autonomous UI blocks (e.g., Sidebar, Analytics Charts).
4.  **Features**: User interactions that bring business value (e.g., Filter Establishments).
5.  **Entities**: Domain models and their specific logic (e.g., Establishment, Review).
6.  **Shared**: Generic, reusable assets and UI components.

> 🛡️ **Rule of Dependencies**: A layer can only import from lower layers. Imports towards higher layers are strictly forbidden.
